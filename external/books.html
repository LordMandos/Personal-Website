                                <h2>By Marcus Aurelius</h2>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p work>The philosopher emperor's journal has been a favorite of mine since before I finished it. The book has no chronology, and can be picked up and opened at any page. This is one of my favorite features, as I have  many times opened the book to my favorite sections and lines. Aurelius is addressing himself but what struck me the most while I was reading is that I felt myself reflecting with him. He retreats to his sanctuary which is his mind and is aware that he is the sole person in charge of his actions. Another thing that stuck with me was the concept of “Merismos” or dissection in latin and how he pieced apart and explained his take on life and death.</p>

                                <h2>By Niccolò Machiavelli</h2>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p work>Machiavelli is now a name associated with acts of deciet and betrayel, however his book The Prince is really just a realistic guide on how, if you should choose to pursue, to obtain and hold on to power in his time period. Many parts of the book are still relevant today, simple but logical fundamentals are laid out such as taking action, dealing with trouble, and when to treat with an opponent.</p>

                                <h2>By J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p work>The Hobbit will always be among my favotite books ever read. The experience I had while reasing it has been unmatched by other fantasy books, it a easy to follow but highly immersive story that takes the reader on a journey through Middle Earth. I pictured the road as the company moved along and the image of the misty mountains, this book has led me to appreciate travelling to new places more. </p>
