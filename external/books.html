                                <h2>By Marcus Aurelius</h2>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p work>The Philosopher Emperor's journal has been a favorite of mine since before I finished it. The book has no chronology and can be picked up and opened at any page. This is one of my favorite features, as I have opened the book many times to my favorite sections and lines. Aurelius is addressing himself but what struck me the most while I was reading is that I felt myself reflecting with him. He retreats to his sanctuary which is his mind and is aware that he is the sole person in charge of his actions. Another thing that stuck with me was the concept of “Merismos” or dissection in Latin and how he pieced apart and explained his take on life and death.</p>

                                <h2>By Fyodor Dostoyevsky</h2>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p work>This is the first book that has ever made me laugh multiple times. Within the first hundred pages Dostoyevsky throws us into an incredibly immersive gathering consisting of multiple characters each with their own personalities. Dostoyevsky manages to have the lead character, a priest, stand to go recieve some communers and we are introduced to more super detailed characters and sub stories this feels incredibly natural. This book is incredible, anyone will find a character they resonate with and a philosophy they can get behind, a funny joke and a relatable story.  </p>

                                <h2>By J.R.R. Tolkien</h2>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <p work>The Hobbit will always be among my favorite books that I have ever read. The experience I had while reading it has been unmatched by other fantasy books, it is an easy to follow but highly immersive story that takes the reader on a journey through Middle Earth. I pictured the road as the company moved along and the image of the misty mountains, this book has led me to appreciate traveling to new places a lot more and to try and be as present as possible when looking upon something new. </p>
